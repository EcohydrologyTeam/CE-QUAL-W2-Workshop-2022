Visualization and Analysis\n","\n","In this workshop, we will be working with a CE-QUAL-W2 meteorology input file. We will:\n","1. Import the w2.py module, which contains several functions that simplify working with CE-QUAL-W2 data\n","2. Display the data in a data table\n","3. Adjust the met data to produce data for an alternative scenario, where air temperature has warmed by two degrees, wind speed has doubled, and a constant 50% cloud cover will be used for the entire simulation period.\n","4. Write the revised data to a new Comma-Delimited Value (CSV) meteorology file, with a special header that CE-QUAL-W2 requires.\n","5. Write the revised data to HDF5 (Heirarchical Data Format, Version 5) format.\n","6.
